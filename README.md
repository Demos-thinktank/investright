### To Run Locally

You can either:

1. Use the following command to start the client and server from the root directory concurrently:
   `npm run start:concurrently`

2. Open a new terminal in in the base directory then run:
   `cd server && npm run dev`
   Once the server is running, open another terminal window and run:
   `cd client && npm start`
